## The Apps

```{admonition} Developer Note - Remove Me!
Manually curated list of other apps that are:
1. Not migrated yet to the new docs system.
2. Built by others in the community.
Should be reviewed periodically to ensure projects are not abandoned, links still work (this can be automated in CI) etc.
